ID,Top Event,Gate Type,Event Description,Event Type,Failure Rate (FIT),Common Cause Flag,Parent Event ID,Safety Mechanism,Notes
FTA-0001,Unintended Acceleration,TOP,"Vehicle accelerates without valid driver or ADS command",Top Event,,No,,,"Top-level hazardous event traced from HARA; relates to SG-01 and SG-02"
FTA-0002,Unintended Acceleration,AND,"Both primary and redundant torque request paths simultaneously command positive torque",Intermediate,,No,FTA-0001,,"AND gate: both independent paths must fail for top event to occur; common cause analysis required per ISO 26262-9"
FTA-0003,Unintended Acceleration,BASIC,"Primary torque controller issues erroneous positive torque command due to software value error",Basic Event,50,No,FTA-0002,"Runtime range check on torque output; independent torque monitor comparing commanded vs. expected","FIT rate based on SN 29500 for microcontroller systematic failure; diagnostic coverage 99% per FMEDA"
FTA-0004,Unintended Acceleration,BASIC,"Redundant torque monitor fails to detect and override erroneous torque command from primary controller",Basic Event,25,No,FTA-0002,"Watchdog timer on monitor processor; periodic end-to-end self-test of comparison logic","FIT rate based on hardware random failure of monitor ASIC; beta factor 2% for common cause per IEC 61508"
